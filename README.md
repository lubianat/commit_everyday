# commit_everyday
An autonomous repository that updates itself everyday


GitHub commits are a measure of efficiency for many. Having a fully green GitHub page is a symbol of dedication, commitment and status. 

This project is a hacky way to improve the appearance of efficiency. Its purpose is merely to exist and update itself every day.

It is for fun, and a message of not judging a book for its cover. Not everything that shines is gold, and quantitative productivity is not the same as being a code expert, or producing significant works (although they might be correlated to some degree).
